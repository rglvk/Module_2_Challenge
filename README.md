# VBA-challenge
I wrote and ran the VBA code in both the alphabetical_testing.xlsm file
and the Multiple_year_stock_data.xlsm file.
The VBA code for both those files should be accessible in the .xlsm files.
I also took a screenshot of the results.

The Multiple_year file was too large and Github didn't allow me to upload it, so I included a google drive link here:
